# ChatBotAI Application Startup Guide

Below you will find the steps required to launch the complete application, consisting of the database, backend (API), and user interface.

---

## üß± Architecture and Future Development

The project documentation includes an example **Event Sourcing Table**, which illustrates the events occurring within the system. This can serve as a reference point for extending the application and implementing mechanisms for logging and tracking changes.

The backend API has been designed following the principles of **Clean Architecture**, using the **CQRS** pattern and the **MediatR** library as a mediator mechanism. The entire API structure is planned to be modular and abstract, making it easier to extend ‚Äî adding new features does not require modifying existing components, but rather extending them.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Items Pending Implementation

At this stage, the project does not yet include several key production-grade mechanisms, which should be added in future iterations:

- Global exception handling
- Input data validation (e.g., using FluentValidation)
- Data mapping (e.g., with AutoMapper)
- Unit tests (e.g., using xUnit)

**ToDo**: The above features are planned for future implementation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup

1. Create a new database (e.g., in SQL Server),
2. Copy the contents of the file: `/Src/Database/Structures/structures.sql` and execute the SQL script in your newly created database to create the structures,
3. Then, copy the contents of the file: `/Src/Database/Data/data.sql` and execute it in the same database to insert initial data.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend (API)

1. Open the project located at `/Src/Backend/ChatBotAI` using your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Rider),
2. In the `appsettings.json` file, update the **Connection String** to point to your database ‚Äî specify the correct database name, username, and password,
3. To use OpenAI features:
   - Configure the project **User Secrets** and add your `OpenAI API Secret Key` under the appropriate key (e.g., `OpenAI:ApiKey`),
4. Run the project ‚Äî the API should be available locally (e.g., at `https://localhost:5176`).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend (Angular)

1. Open your terminal/console and navigate to: `/Src/Frontend/ChatBotAi`,
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm ci
3. Start application:
   ```bash
   ng serve
